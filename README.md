Homebrew tap for HyperDex.

## Installation
`brew tap homebrew/dupes`

`brew tap seanogden/hyperdex && brew install hyperdex`

Optional client bindings can be individually selected with
`brew install --enable-java-bindings --enable-python-bindings --enable-ruby-bindings hyperdex`

## Caveats

This will also install gcc 4.7.2, which takes a long time.
